1. What is the difference between var, let, and const?

        Answer: 
                var     : Function-scoped, can be re-declared and updated. Hoisted.
                let     : Block-scoped, can be updated but not re-declared in the same scope.
                const   : Block-scoped, cannot be updated or re-declared.


2. What is the difference between map(), forEach(), and filter()?

        Answer: 
                map()           : Loops through array items, applies a function, and returns a new array with transformed values. Same length as original.
                forEach()       : Loops through array items, executes a function, but does not return anything.
                filter()        : Loops through array items, applies a condition, and returns a new array with only items that pass the test. Length may change.

4. How does destructuring assignment work in ES6?

5. Explain template literals in ES6. How are they different from string concatenation?

        Answer:
                Template literals in ES6 are strings defined with backticks (`) that support embedded expressions (${}), multi-line strings, and string interpolation.

        Difference from string concatenation:
                i) Template literals are cleaner and more readable, especially for variables and multi-line text.
                ii) Concatenation (+) is longer and harder to manage with complex strings.
